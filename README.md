# LearnNodeJs [1 out of 3 Apps]

I'm picking up NodeJS through Andrew Mead's Udemy Course - The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)

This is the first application I'm building with Node - A Note Taking Application

What I've learnt:

* Importing of modules (node.js core modules, npm and my own JS files)
* Printing console messages in colour using Chalk
* Defining Arguments using Yargs (mandatory, data type and handler)
* File System
* JSON (Storing and Retrieving of JSON data)
